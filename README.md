# Manual_image_decision_processing
 Some code I made to help me decide which color maps i like and easily catalog it 

Since I made this in 30 minutes to save me a lot of time processing data, it doesnt have any functionality for scripting or paramaters for how many images are in a set (4) or how many decissions you can make but it would be rather easy to implement if you desired - Frankly, I only made this repo public because of the lack of JS and CSS on my public github.


# To use
1. Clone repository
2. Add a zip file of your data analytics images called "preprocessed_photos.zip"
3. Run the unpack python code
4. Open index.html (in browser)
5. Done. You can now decide "yex, no, maybe" on your images 4 at a time
